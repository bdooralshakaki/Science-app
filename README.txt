My Section of the App is Support. There are 3 subjects; Biology, Chemistry 
& Physics.Each of these sections have a support classes & support videos section. 
  The support videos section includes JButtons which have the icons set as images 
the videos. When the user clicks the button it goes straight to the video on 
YouTube. I used snipper tool on my laptop to get the images of the videos from 
YouTube then I used a code from StackOverflow to link the video URLs to the 
buttons. Ideally I would have had the YouTube videos embedded into the app but 
this was very difficult & I couldn't find any good examples. When researching 
this I looked on YouTube, various websites, I got help from my lecturer also but
i think the research I got from StackOverflow was most helful. I was proud of 
using my idea to link the videos to JButtons as I spent a long time researching 
this as it is something we did not cover in class.
  The support classes section includes a list of classes for each topic in 
every province. On the bottom of the page there is an enroll form. This form 
has various buttons such as Add, Clear, Display All, Search, Delete, Save, View 
& Back to Support. The Save buttons writes to a file & the View Button reads from 
a file.

My section of the App was the Quiz, within the quiz there
 is 3 categories, Biology, chemistry and physics, you can pick a section to answer questions on.
 There are 5 questions in the biology and chemistry section and 3 in the physics.
There is an ArrayList in my section and also File I/O. 
you can add your answer to the arraylist and then View it, 
and you can also write you answer to an external File and View it.
 after the 5 questions are completed, you are given the correct answers
 and then given two options to either return to the
 homepage or attempt the quiz again, there are also clear buttons on each GUI, 
which enabled the user to deleted the text they have entered into the TextBox.

examination, subject and year.When you click on the junior Cet or the leaving Cert button,
 it goes to a page where you can pick 
Exampapers or makring scheme. I used a code from StackOverflow to link 
the exampapers and the maring scheme.

View and Back buttons, i used an ArrayList and File I/O.

During my project i took it upon myself to look into other alternatives not thought in the classroom. 
I liked the idea of selection through radio buttons. I reserched and found out how to use radio buttons.
 A selection of If Statements is the key to getting them right.
I also renamed the GUI and refactored each one as at the beginning we did not do so.
 I also connected each image to one image as when we all added all the GUIS together,
 a alternative of images were all added in.
